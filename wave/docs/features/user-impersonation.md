# User Impersonations

With user impersonations you can easily impersonate any user on your site. This will come in handy when you need to debug an issue that a specific user is experiencing.

Impersonating a user will allow you to login to your application acting as a specific user.

You will now see that you are logged in as that specific user. You can click the **Leave Impersonation** button to exit that user account and log back in as your original admin user.

Impersonations... 🍰 Piece of cake, right?
